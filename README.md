# OSLab-P3

In this course project, we are required to implement a memory allocator just like malloc in C Language. We used a 16-byte header to trace each allocated block. There are 3 free space allocation strategies available: first fit, last fit and best fit. 

In some situation, our allocator even runs faster than the GNU C version, you can find related performance analysis in my presentation file.
